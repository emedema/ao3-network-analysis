# ao3-network-analysis

Fandom communities surrounding pieces of media are regularly generating and interacting with content and eachother online. One of the most prolific and widespread sources of interaction is the creation and consumption of fanfiction. Fanfiction is an untapped resource for analyses of fandom communities and internet culture. 

One of the main hubs of fanfiction is [Archive of our Own (AO3)](https://archiveofourown.org/). We intend to use data collected from this archive of fanfiction to gain a better understanding of fandom community and culture.
